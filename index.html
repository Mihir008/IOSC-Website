    <h2> What is Open Source?</h2>
    <p>
        The term originated in the context of software development to designate a specific approach to creating computer
        programs. Today, however, “open source” designates a broader set of values- what we call “the open source way.”
        Open source projects, products, or initiatives embrace and celebrate principles of open exchange, collaborative
        participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development.
